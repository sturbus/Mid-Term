new
 allowed someone to make changes to my account and wont put my account back to basic now they deleted my account when i paid on the th the price for  tv march th  i was promised that my account was to be fixed back to basic its showing the proof by my snapshots my account was hacked im a senior citizen on a fixed income please  help me happy with the netflix time period for transferring profile information from one account to a new one netflix should allow more time when transferring profile information 
opened a new account on the st march  and on the nd march  could not transfer from my daughters account to my new account this is ridiculous if you would like to call me for further information  protected or protected have been using netflix for two years now and it has come to my attention how they represent muslim characters women are not dressed according to islamic religion and they usually have arabic names you do not need to be arab in order to be muslim every person on this earth despite nationality 
and race can be muslim with their own choice netflix in films and etc represents islam in a very bad light that is not respectful to me as a muslim women also why is every muslim girl named something like malha girls named like jessica or bradley can also be muslim for further explanation look show  reasons why se min till the end an issue with netflix loading did all trouble shooting steps contacted support via chat chat refused to forward problem or give any reference information to show i contacted them
with issue called netflix informed them i did all troubleshooting steps they refused to forward my issue or help without me redoing all the steps they acted like they couldnt understand me put me on hold and then disconnected the call ive been with netflix since  and never had issue but this is unacceptable and unprofessional content of this program is far and above the age of  given the amount of extreme sexual content violence use of and parental support offor underage use of alcohol and illegal drugs this
show is very clearly not rated appropriately additionally the inclusion of teenage self harm is not only dangerous given our culture and climate as we emerge from the pandemic but it is abhorrently irresponsible content is designed to brainwash you viewers i dont care what people do within the privacy of their home however i have had enough of this woke bs ie a censored under every rock pedophile in every crack lesbian in every corner vanhelsing  lesbian story for the most part if my kids were still young i 
would never let them watch this garbage i believe that netflix should be boycotted by all a wokegay content filter at the minimum i have closed my account clear that the content for this show is not suitable for young viewers as evidenced by the very first episode the show has inappropriate sexual situations including masturbation and the use of sex toys the mother coaches the daughter in how to give a bill what the hell there are also scenes of selfharm and other violence which makes it even more unsuitable 
for young audience it is unacceptable that such a show is being marketed to teens and given a tv rating rectify this issue apparently there are plenty of adults dont understand this either that enjoy watching them but you must take measures to ensure that your shows are properly rated for their intended audience this one you got markedly wrong chasing a dollar at our childrens expense waited with baited breathe for the return of season  of black af Netflix canceled season two with all of the horrible content 
stupid reality shows and bs specials why is af not coming back to netflix this was our cosby show but of course since the take over the brash in your faceness made folks feel a certain way seeing the hillbarris you people on netflix this past weekend is making us miss that much needed season two of af just bring it back has come to my attention that in the turkish movie koprudekiler displays a dart board with the icon of the virgin mary as the target this is highly offensive to all people of the christian faith
i will be taking this issue to the archdiocese so that they can take legal measures and make sure that the film is immediately removed from the netflix platform decided agent elivis was more important than inside job and i hope yall know it is not i will not be watching agent elvis i will be cancling my subscription with net flix and i will be cancling my companys subscription with netflix and gettting hulu your competitor instead you have lost my buisness for good unless you get inside job back i hope you know 
i have givien each of my employs there own netflixs accout so thats alot of money you will losing so i came back to watch some of my shows you want to put commercials fine but when im paying for a service for tv and theres more commercials then regular cable its ridicules i pay more for this service than any other service i watch at least their commercials time isnt excessive like netflix do better stop being a money grubbing business tried to sign up my  year old dad to netflix who agreed to the  a month charge
my bank flaged my credit card and said it was fraud  netflix is charging  up front no explination why so i cancelled it and now i have to get a new credit card  weeks wait  if netflix would explain the extra charge up front there wouldnt be any issue it seems they hold a sign up fee for a few weeks then return the money but dont explain it it sure did screw me and my credit card up provide more accurate content warnings you post warnings about smoking yet dont think you need to mention homosexuality or lbgqt content
i have no objection to people living their lives as they see fit i just dont want to have it dropped in my lap without warning in the middle of a movie at least give a heads up by mentioning it in the content warning a disgrace for netflix to spend millions od dollars to promote a grotesque whineathon about  privileged people attempting to rip part their family billions live in poverty and struggle beyond belief yet netflix promote such nonsense bitter people who yearn for privacy air their poor me nonsense is revolting
to watch and certainly does netflix no credibility i will cancel all netflix contact and urge others to consider their financing of this company should be ashamed of yourselves putting this trash on tv i have no boycotted watching your shows because of your disrespect to our late queen and the royal family it shows the ignorance of meghan and most americans when it comes to british royal traditions  curtsying is one of these traditions shame shame shame on your netflix and the sooner you realise any decent person wants 
nothing to do with harry and meghan the better signed up over  months ago at  a monththey have been overcharging me for the last  months that i can see on their billing website for  i have finally spoken to someone with half a brain who was willing to refund me for  month  i cancelled my account  they claim they have no further billing information other then the past  months this is pure blatant fraud its outrageous you say on your website that you want to show diverse shows then why have you taken away shows from ireland whales scotland 
norway england switzerland denmark iceland russia sweden hungary new zealand and australia showing asian spanish mexican indian bollywood and african nollywood shows is not diverse you are aiming at that audience only this is why netflix is losing money i suggest you start showing shows that people like to watch not knock offs from those countries korea is particularly bad at copying western shows and they are very c grade knock offs began taking money from an old acct that i cancelled in  in april  they gave me every excuse 
about why they are not allowed to refund me but  months worth with all three phone calls that i made they would put me on hold and make me wait for long periods of time just to come back and say the couldnt find a supervisor they are stealing my money and others and dont wont to admit or give it back i will tell everyone that i know about them nw bought the basic package  months ago they sucked me in for  a month since then it went up to over  that is a  increase one more increase and i am dropping these highway robbers there is many other companies
even free ones is real simple i paid for it i can do what i want with it if i want bob down the street to watch with me then as long as im not using more screens than i have access to which never happens i should be able to do as i please netflix is the only company that does thisand on top of that they have the same programming as hulu and amazon prime bad bad bad i hope they hit rock bottom canceled my account will never do business with them again the past two years it appears netflix has intentionally slowed down dvd deliveries through the 
usps i used to get two movies a week then it went to one now im only getting a delivery about every two weeks netflix is blaming the usps but the usps is claiming they do not have a manpower issue so what is it tends the raise their prices on a yearly basis but not even provide us great content for what we are paying i use to say for cad its ok but now  years later its cad and what new movies have they brought out for us just a whole lot of dubbed foreign films i had originally started up this account for the kids but  permonth seems to be highway
robbery considering were getting less actual english speaking films and soooo much dubbed foreign films prime is no better but at least im not paying for it and it comes as a part of my prime account which is much cheaper by the month than netflix cancelled membership and they cont to charge account for eights months i spoke to their customer service and they could only refund  months they stated that it was accidental restarted they refused to refund the other six months this is theft and they should be criminally prosecuted thing you can always
count on with netflix is another price increase we have been subscribers for what seems like a lifetime and have seen our monthly fees well over double ie  increase by over  during that time kind of tired about hearing about all the great content they deliver as every time they raise their fees for standard service by a  per month they gross another  million per month or  billion annually based upon their approximately  million customers for that kind of cash they should offer much better just received an announced price increase it only shows 
increase per month which is not so bad but it represents an over  percent increase that is ridiculous given the economic climate this year they noted it was to bring us getter movies but they would have to do that anyways to stay in business i guess they really dont care about the customer at all with this outrageous increase looking for alternative providers that care has lost thousands of titles all movies and shows by netflix are  most are too short they end stupid they only have  or  seasons and what is left is outdated movies whereas amazon 
prime and others have newer shows and movies available tired of being let down watching great series or movies only to be disappointed and their support the worst in the world always had the high def plan but times are tough so i downgraded the downgrade should only be the pixel quality but it isnt everything i watched was choppy this is how they get you to upgrade by making your watching experience annoying its a rip off very careful if you use netflix if youre not it could give your computer a virtual incurable std really let me explain a couple of
years ago i got really sick im talking about not being able to leave bed and just wishing that it would just all end and this is embarrassing to admit but i also needed something playing to help me sleep i only had netflix so i used it next to all of the time because of all of that netflix decided that i binge watched too much they decided to punish me by automatically skipping over the recap of the previous episodes even though i have always wanted to watch it i personally feel like even if i know what has happened if i dont watch the recap then im 
missing something thats just my opinion and i thought that is what i was paying for asked me to update credit card information it will not let me update it when i called netflix they charged a different account with the new credit card but not my account now they will not credit me back for the charge they did on another account or transfer that payment to my account and they are telling me that the only way to keep my account operating is with netflix gift cards how greedy has corporate america become they steal from me and to keep on using them they 
will not even refund what they stole shame in the height of a pandemic so many people lost their jobs there are long lines on food banks some people are losing their homes and businesses and netflix decides to raise prices shame kind even magnanimous to extend to the general public a whole weekend of free streaming while the rest of us suckers who pay have to suffer the consequences of an obviously overloaded server situation next time you do charity work could you give the rest of us a heads up that would be great also since its free this weekend im sure well get discount after 
 all you wouldnt really be able to afford such a gracious gift without your regular longterm customers now is not the time to start taking us for granted tried to set up a netflix account netflix said my credit cards were declined i tried  in total they were active and valid i called each lending institution one did decline the charge of course they could not tell me why that card had a zero balance due two cards had no record of an attempt to charge the process of setting up an account then required my phone number after must deliberation i decided to enter
 my phone number to text me a code to finish setting up my account i tried  times send me a code again each code did not work i called the netflix number the person said my card was rejected but could not tell me why and said to try again in  hours albeit she could log into my account poor poor process it should not be this hard canceled the society season  due do covid the part im confused about how they canceled the show due increase of production costs and covid concerns but they be be making new shows and movies netflix originals like every week so why not 
 continue with season  they are just canceling shows for respectful reasons but they are making new ones constantly thats like being hypocritical to themselves cancelled my subscription to netflix in october after having it for a couple of years i just ran out of movies to watch on nov th they stopped my account as they were supposed to then on nov th at  pm i get a email from them welcoming me back i checked with my bank and they said netflix ran a charge against my account for  the most ive ever paid for the netflix service was  the banker i spoke with said that this 
 was not uncommon for netflix and that they had this issue frequently they told me that the only thing i could do to avoid the charge going through was to call netflix and tell them you needed them to do an immediate manual reversal this is something that the banker told me they had done before have been with netflix since it started and every few years it increases in price it is now up to  still an okay price to pay but i dont go to netflix much anymore and the quality is not there anymore every time i get excited for a new movie or series they have released it is badly 
 dubbed or foreign i know they are trying to reach a larger audience but they should put this information in the description they are just not coming out with enough good content to justify the price anymore i use prime and hulu much more now and i wish they would bring back the rating system the annual price hike their base content is never strong enough to justify its pricing whenever they do make good great content they cancel the show after  seasons not worth my time anymore had recently got my standard netflix account hacked and i did happen to get it sorted out however
 i could not access my account for several days and the hacker had changed my netflix to premium without my knowledge netflix then told me i couldnt do anything about it and they wouldnt bother to refund me for literally  days of it being premium which i couldnt access anymore as they changed all the details email address etc their website is the one that wasnt secure so i dont think i should have to fork out the extra money for this spoke with a customer support specialist today about a year long issue and was told that it was basically my fault for thinking that the previous
 netflix customer service representative did their job i called in a year ago to let them know that i suspected fraud and was told either change your password or cancel the account and open a new account i chose to cancel the account and open a new account with payment through another source fast forward a year they have been billing me through two accounts and told me since i didnt finish the cancellation process i was just paying for someone to watch netflix for free for a year was mistake when i started watching netflix i deleted my account and will never watch netflix 
 again netflix should stop making movies and stop insulting religions and people should wakeup and see what netflix is doing contacted netflix about the cuties movie and i told them that the movie is gross and it promotes child pornography in case you dont know what cuties is about it is about little  and yearold girls twerking and dancing naked in a dance competition im sorry i dont know the whole scenario and i dont want to know they came back with these responses cuties is an important comingofage film that shows how young girls act at a young age it is a
 must watch film and we have no plans of removing the film from our library i feel very disheartened about netflix i feel that they are hiding secrets that they do not want us to know i will never rent another movie from them again viewers who watch the movie are considered pedophiles signed up for the free trial to see if our family would like it better than another service at a similar price we did not and decided to cancel after cancelling i found i was still getting charged customer service claimed i had  accounts sounds similar to other peoples issues
 and one was still running and being charged but was with an email address that could have been me mistyping but it seems weird now that other people have had the same issue they were also very rude about it was a netflix customer for years until recently i discovered netflix was charging my debit card for my  subscription but also a total strangers  subscription in another country but after reading other reviews of double payments im beginning to question the honesty of this company with  million subscribers youd only have to doub
 le charge a few unnoticed million to make a lot more money they will not refund my  months they charged me for the strangers subscription im a senior and cant afford someone cheating me imonot an honest company is far behind the times when it comes to account management if the person who originally signed up as the defaultmaster account is no longer a part of the household there is no way to change the default owner this is so far behind the times its absurd creating a new account means that your viewing history is lost this is not 
 a technological impossibility it is simply a policy that is absolutely stupid would like to see more old movies and comedy movies i am yrs old and would like to see different sitcoms and movies pertaining more to my age group there are too many scifi and horror movies than anything else i like the older movies and sitcoms i am sure there is an audience for these have had the worse experience with netflix customer service today and this isnt the first time i would cancel if it wasnt for my niece watching it and i care about her i spent two
 hour trying to verify my account because my credit card was stolen instead of taking my new credit card they wanted me to cancel and sign up again because i couldnt verify the old credit card dah it was stolen i dont remember my credit card numbers movies go away for a while then they are right back no new movies even some old westerns would be nice kinda disappointed when i first started it was ok but that was it went downhill these movies now are old movies would recommend not subscribing to netflix the movie content is not good i have been subscribed to top service for  or  weeks so far no movie has played properly they stop to buffer or stop and go to home screen i have a roku tv none of my other streaming channels do this they play perfectly netflix will not give a refund for something that does not work dont subscribe poor service
 wife and i havent been able to figure out why the netflix streaming is so bad especially when the other streaming platforms are so good on our k tv i just found out that netflix has different streaming quality plans were only getting sd  because we have the basic plan the quality of the streaming is awful we thought it was our internet for a while because we couldnt imagine that netflix would stream at such low quality twice overdrafts twice over bogus billing i am on disability the two  dollar overdraft fees killing me as two months in a row they
 return  but dont pay the overdraft fees they caused and i never restarted netflix they just keep canceling and charging me i want my  they have cost me but they dont care about their mistakes of the tactics netflix uses to fleece money from your linked bank accounts many years back i had a netflix account but cancelled when tmobile offered free netflix with our plan this has been going on for some  years now and we did enjoy it without warning or notification of any kind netlfix started billing us in april of this year my wife pays the bills and figured i 
 had ordered something new i was going over statements today and was shocked to see a charge from netflix even more shocked when i realized we have been being billed for  months of service that was supposed to be free i could give them  stars i would i have now spoken with netflix seven times in the past month someone keeps hacking into my account i have spoken with managers supervisors and everyone else apparently they have no way to fix this they repeat themselves like broken records change email change password change credit card etc all this was done and
 again i am hacked into  they change my email and password changed my credit card again a week later i am calling again it is ridiculous calling again for the seventh time and no resolution they have nothing they can do and do not provide any resolution but the same steps that i have done now  different times i am sick of netflix and done with them
 netflix account is created in india but currently i am living in germany i want to pay from here but there is no common payment gateway as it was created in india it is showing only indian payment options i want to tell netflix to work on this issue been on the phone for over an hour in relation to some unknown person hijacking my account for the past three months it started in july my first contact was in august customer service created a new account in addition to the hijacked account without informing me of dual accounts after two months of multiple charges i found out about the second account and complained
 anyone else getting double charged for netflix netflix automatically took  this month from my account in  payments of  im the only one who uses it so why am i get charged like this they say i have to wait  days for a refund that ill probably never receive yet they just took the money  min ago now this is unsettling and unfair its thanksgiving and i could have used that  weird company about to switch to crave or streaming my tv free heck the ads i can deal with instead of paying almost  a month for the same shows year after year
 service lots of movies both stories and documentaries to choose from plenty of diverse selections and easy to scan thru and choose what to watch easy interface for search and selection of what to watch many seasons of old and new sitcoms fantastic service enjoy netflix however i dont think they have enough  romantic comedies sometimes the app is not that great with suggesting shows that you may like i also dont like how many of the representation matters programs for  people are centered around police violence its very triggering to see that every time you watch a movie ive noticed in many of netflix programming that they like to add in these triggering scenes and its becoming quite predictable overall the app is good and is a good alternative to cable we need more light hearted programming less focused on social themes just some funny shows to watch
 really happy with the service everything is as it shows and i have no issues netflix has been resourceful and easy to operate i have always recommended this service to my friends and family my kids use it a lot more than me because there is a variety of choices and there are a lot of family things to watch together they just need to update more movies and everything would be all set
 provides excellent movies to watch via streaming it also provides an excellent choice of different shows to watch and select from however we are interested to find and utilize a streaming service that would enable us to cut our electricity bill is fine for this geezer it doesnt have everything i would like to see but then i can shop around for other things sometimes i go to amazon prime which also has more limited selection but something of interest to me however i am fed up with political outrage outrage from all parties and sanitized unrealistic gun violence
 have a lot of choices but i enjoy netflix the most because they have a large variety of stuff to watch hulu is great for catching up on tv programs and amazon fire allows me to see new stuff all ot them are good and really helped me from going crazy during the pandemic is an outstanding streaming service easy to use friendly customer service award winning high quality up to date diverse content affordable etc netflix alone can meet all your entertainment needs i highly recommend giving it a try
 has a huge lack of latinospanishlanguage content the most relevant category in movies spanishlanguage movies rarely has new content the list of available movies has not changed much for over a year the story is similar with shows a  article by cnn  cites a study which found that only  of main cast members went to latino actors and filmmakers during jan   dec  even though latinos make up roughly  of the us population many other articles have been published on this issue in the last couple years but netflix is still not doing enough a number of articles also point out the drop in latino memberships that netflix has suffered as a result of it overlooking this demographic in its content
 and affordable love it can cancel anytime but dont you will just sign back up again plus you can have plans for  a month on up to  devices and that includes your tv or phone its easy to look up favorite movies too have belonged to netflix for many years i do not like how much the monthly fee go up each year i am paying about  each month it keeps me from joining any other services and there are shows i wish i could watch but they are on other providers so far i am finding things to watch on netflix but i wish i did not have to join so many others in order to try out different shows for example i wish i could watch the handmaids tale on hulu
 is smart and easy to quickly navigate to titles by name or type of film also film summaries display quickly making selection details decisions easy ratings popularity of each selection readily visible plus feedback can be made with comments have been disabled for years if it wasnt for netflix and other streaming opportunities i could not have made it i am on medications that do not give me much time to go outdoors i spend most of my time just relaxing while in pain pain sometimes so bad that i cannot do much netflix offers a wide variety of programs that not only pique my interest but allows me for times to forget the pains and uneasiness that i go through daily also allowing me times to stay informed of things that are going on outside and in the world today i hope that their continued variety they offer will make things more exciting and bearable to get me through the hard times i face now and in the future may the lord bless us all especially those facing the same as myself thank you for this opportunity today for being able to voice my opinion may this help others
 can always find a good movie when there is no good programs on the network enjoy most of them and some have to many f words for me to watch the charge is a fairly good price for the amount of time i use it was able to keep good content across age groups in my family we are able to watch current shows as well as family favorites something i have really enjoyed recently were the addition of netflix movies produced by netflix with top actors
 is great the only set back is time between new content or new seasons but theres plenty to watch hundreds of movies as well as shows i think it would be better to spread out the seasons i like the user interface super easy to understand even for new users great selection and a fair price i believe all packages should come with at least two screens
 think they should have an option to pay for a year and they need to add better horror options honestly need to add a better selection of each genre i do enjoy some of the netflix original movies and series quality of the video of a number of different movies is very good as well as the dolby digital  audio soundtrack the consistent streaming without buffering is greatly appreciated we stream this service using a d bluray player into a onkyo dolby digital  surround sound system and an overhead p projector giving us an  ft wide by  ft high image which is basically our own private imax
 is a great movie website to use with a variety of options that you can choose to fit your needs netflix has three plans based on cost number of devices you can have downloads on unlimited shows and quality of content the plans range from   to  once you sign up you are charged once a month on the date you signed up for they offer the convenience to change your plan or cancel at any time once you exit out of your show they automatically pause where you left off netflix has series shows movies and tv shows if you are looking for something to just come home and relax to after a long day then netflix is perfect for you
 have been with netflix doing the mail order thing for  years now i hate them but there are few alternatives to getting dvds in the mail there are only a couple companies that do it and they are more expensive and have even fewer titles on the shelf i have about a hundred gripes about netflix
 changes always the same showsmovies netflix series dont finish stories they just end a show some dont even have the full series there are so many choices that browsing is near impossible every show is every genre so you keep seeing stuff youve already passed over multiple times scifi does not equal horror new episodes are not true at all they have shows marked that way that have not had a new episode in years they have tons of shows and movies whats not said is they are  stuff that looks shot in film school yes that includes  of netflix shows including the anime
 was with netflix since  i fell on some hard times my bill was due on the th i asked if i could pay  they said no im a loyal customer times are hard i canceled ive paid on time for almost three years and they werent willing to work with me for  days i will never go back the stupid thing is that they are losing money because i can just use someone elses account
 again tubi is better than netflix and how could they start charging more from people during a pandemic they are not worth paying for in my opinion and never ever have the movies i want i discontinued my account with netflix and will never go back i have amazon prime that is a hell of a lot cheaper than netflix and better in every way refuse refund money taken without consent netflix has been taking double payments for over  year and has refused to refund all payments taken without my consent instead they offer  months refund and they want keep  months i never will trust netflix again and will pass to the bank to recover all money taken without consent
 recently called because i was having problems watching a movie on netflix a tech support person while troubleshooting for me i asked where their engineers are trained retorted this was a racists comments against us  and suggested that i unplug the tv and it should resolve the problem my tv was not attainable after stating this comment against his people it was just a question he disconnected the call what is this phenomenon that is going on everywhere that if someone doesnt like what a customer says on the phone the caller disconnects the call having worked for marriott for several years for such telephone etiquette i would have been fired no coaching or anything
 love netflix if you have tmobile as your phone carrier you get it for free only complaint is they got rid of schitts creek  but they have a great variety i think a lot of good tv series movies has been many months and i cannot watch anything the upload keeps circling as if trying to connect but it doesnt often the system keeps asking me to restart the app but still not working on most occasions i need to log into the app repeatedly and can still not watch anything fraud and rip off
 i got bank records showing that netflix is charging me  a month for services apparently for accounts that dont exist when i try to log in they want me to pay another  just to log in can we say fraud suspended our dvd plan some time ago because we found that we were not using dvds anymore however after suspending this part of our plan we were still being charged month  for not getting any dvds when i made this change it did not tell me that i would still be charged for the dvd plan why anyone would want to suspend their dvd plan and be charged for it i have no idea  i have called customer service and they said it has to be canceled a suspension just stops the dvds from being delivered to your house netflix could be more clear about this on their website very misleading check your bill and see what they are charging you for
 do not recommend netflix to anyone on at least two occasions my account has been compromised most recently my card was charged when i canceled my subscription months ago my email is airtight and i could see that it was hacked from different countries i do not trust this company whatsoever because they do not protect the information of its customers ive never had a problem with accounts getting hacked with anything else netflix if youre going to charge so much for mostly subpar content at least update your security to protect your customers
 signaling is the worst we all know the guy who thinks hes all that he goes around telling you how hes done everything and how good he is at whatever job you went to  years of college to learn how to do but have you ever seen him do it have you ever seen him hold the door for an old lady at walmart have you ever seen him get out of the car on a rainy day to catch a shopping cart thats rolling wildly through the parking lot i bet you havent and if you do know a guy who does that stuff on the reg i bet he doesnt go around telling you about it
 the past  months i have been experiencing problems with my netflix account i try to access the app and it wont load i try to play a show and it continues to spin that its loading movies and shows will stop playing in the middle of the program i am unable to watch anything again for at least  hours then everything is running smooth again until the next time
 it works its fine content is a little boring needs more varied selection the app randomly kicks me out in mid playback doesnt happen every day but some days its impossible to continue watching a program i have a  mbps connection so its not that it also does not happen on disney hulu or prime or any of a dozen adsupported apps only netflix since i usually just switch to another service when it happens twice during a program im thinking i might be better off just cancelling it for a year or so to see if they can get their act together
 have been a netflix customer for more than  years now i had to call them because i just discover they have been billing me twice monthly so when i asked them to reimburse me the whole time they have been double billing me they said they cant because there is another account on my billing so netflix is scamming customers and they dont take account you are a loyal customer so i am done with netflix and i will advise anyone if you want to get scam be my guest otherwise stay away from netflix
 has really gone down hill they charge way too much money and any time they get a new series thats any good they cancel after one season i actually got so frustrated that i stopped using my app i get a tear free through my phone but i wont be continuing i would rather watch a streaming service that continues to provide entertainment for current customers than one who only cares about getting new subscribers they dont care about keeping long time customers happy at all which is a shame would give  stars if i could
 will not be rejoining until you meet the standard resolution p for  a month have you ever watched p on a  inch tv well it is similar to watching an old vhs tape in the early s no wonder you are losing business i used to enjoy netflix contacted netflix about an issue with downloading their content and it not working once offline after an hour of waiting for them to file with the technical department i was told it had been escalated and to just check back from time to time to see if it was working i felt this was not a good enough answer and someone should contact me to let me know what the problem was and if it had been corrected they told me they could not i then talked with a supervisor that told me the same thing after this i said i should at least receive a refund for a month since my service was not fully working even though this problem had been going on for many months they said they would not refund any amount i feel it is very poor company that is making a lot of money but cant refund a customer that is having a problem with their service that they are paying for netflix is a poorly ran company
 use to get some pretty good series on netflix now almost every series is made in a different country and english is dubbed in the quality is so bad i am now looking for a different streaming service i prefer americanenglish speaking shows not foreign films get me wrong netflix is a great app and i really enjoy it but im very upset about how theyre taking off criminal minds seasons  on june th  and theyre taking off corpse bride which im very upset about too but they are other apps to watch criminal minds on but i enjoyed watching it on netflix more than any other app because they are no adds and amazing quality its overall a great app
 account sold out to somewhere on web now they want me to pay  per month get the hell out of here when talking to people and they in philippines they dont know crap i tried to cancel asap but they want this n that plus my card number hell nope not stupid the years ive enjoyed many a relaxing evening watching quality movies and shows on netflix but in the past few years netflix has taken a turn to be fair it may not be just netflix alone in the landscape of a craven and agendadriven entertainment industry but because it controls so many hundreds of millions of production dollars and is the number one streaming platform i feel netflix is highly culpable
 love netflix however if commercials are added im canceling my subscription i am tired of interruptions due to useless commercials enough already im paying for no commercials keep it that way service mostly old stuff and now going after password sharing  its not like we are making a business out it we just use it between family and will be penalize just for that we agree its time to move on to a better content and more actualized platform
 have been a netflix member for many years i am now considering canceling my subscription because netflix has gone too far with the repetitive price increases i have also noticed an increase of foreign action and horror movies that i have no interest in therefore i dont understand why i am being recommended these movies i have began watching tv shows and new release movies on other streaming services
 said they have lost revenue in last quarter and possibly more but they have millions of subscribers now they cry about people sharing passwords but it wasnt a problem before and not to mention jacking their prices all the time me personally im scratching netflix its one thing that gets my attention is a co that whines while sticking it to their customers just a thought netflix has gone downhill if they add commercials i will definitely cancel my subscription already went through  price increases for that i stick to cable hulu and every other app that have commercials is still okay movies are so and so what is really bad and shameful is the movie abstract that brief description of what the movie is about lately netflix doesnt write anything or just copies the cast names like we are stupid and do not know the names are a little bit more to the left on our screen you have no clue what movie you will see this may be just because they cut funding and use a robot or an idiot or can be a mischievous secret procedure to force you see bad movies until you are tired and go to bed i am disappointed
 have been a netflix member for years and just this month they canceled me out of the blue what kind of company does that to a customer that has been paying them for years they dont care about their customers they charge way too much to just cancel you like that they dont even care to fix their mistake money hungry people i think people should research this bad company before becoming a member they dont treat their members very good
 a new customer to netflix i watched my credit card statement for the first bill my statement showed four billings in one month all for the same amount one billing was the supposed total monthly amount netflix customer service told me that there was a mistake with the original setup that caused the extra billings to my chagrin they then told me there was nothing they could do as they cannot change the system after holding for a supervisor for what seemed an eternity i was told the same thing cannot change the system it seems to me there is something seriously wrong with a  billion dollar company that cannot correct mistakes in customer billing buyer beware
 have increased the prices for the dvd plans and have slowed the service by mailing from across the country to get them to me ca to tx even though distribution centers are also in tx usps adds to the delay by losing items and just being late for  dvds mailed back to them on the same day from the post office they will show the nd one returned days after recording the first one returned not worth the money for the plan with  dvds out at a time i got maybe  dvds per month i cancelled after several years of much better service from them  am never going back
 netflix led the way in western entertainment but as of late almost all of their new content is made for international audiences it is no wonder that their stock took a  shave and they are losing subscribers to their growing competitors like aol in the s netflix will be relegated to the past good riddance selected a basic plan which should have been  but was charged  when i called to have netflix fix the problem i was transferred to a rep in india who wasnt able to help there are so many other streaming services netflix should really stop pushing their premium service and prices on customers
 just canceled my netflix im a computer programmer i used to have anxiety i enjoy having a tv playing in the background preferably seinfeld ive been getting extremely aggravated lately because im getting asked if im still watching my show this has caused my anxiety to come back now i got to thinking about this if i go to a dealership and buy a brand new vehicle lets say i paid cash at  i drive off the lot im almost home its a hour drive my brand new vehicle shuts off the lights dim and a message pops up on my radio asking me if im still driving
 needs to fix the issues with freezing up every time we search for a movie or try to play a movie this problem has been going on way too long youre the only streaming that does this were thinking strongly about canceling our service since you dont care enough about your customers to fix these issues cancelled my netflix subscription in february  as i went onto my sisters family plan and shared the cost with her i recently discovered that i have been being charged the monthly subscription fee since may  i have just been told that somehow my account was restarted without my knowledge or authorisation most likely because a device in our house was still logged in and someone opened it and pressed play on something and it automatically reactivated the account didnt require a password or credit card details to be entered to confirm or authorise the account to be restarted nothing
 put netflix is wildly out of touch with its fans literally every show i have found on netflix that i actually enjoy and watch seems to get cancelled within one or two seasons while the most toxic trivial cookie cutter fare stays on the service forever there are very few movies worth watching and lets face it the vast majority of the original content they produce is dull as staring at rocks i have repeatedly come back to the service in hopes they have finally gathered some good content or have at least begun keeping the shows i want to watch around every time i renew my service i get the same result  i find there is nothing i want to see or havent already seen within the first month and i never end up using the account
  i request someone to listen to my call centre calls attempt netflix is so incredible with customers allowing a ripped off and they will never investigate your issue being so irresponsible with their clients its very annoying feeling that no one is willing to help you netflix is in almost everyones home yet they really seem not to care solving problems or to respect their customers due to many excuses  blaming much on customer end and worse they claim giving credits while they didnt and they refuse listening to previous records
 cancel really great series too soon often after st or nd season shadow hunters half bad the society as a few examples also they have way too much foreign content and yet axe shows like i have just mentioned step up your game netflix as there are lots of cheaper and better streaming services out there shadow hunters tv series which came to an abrupt end with no support from you for release on dvd blu ray in the us even though it has a huge following but can be found online in almost all other regions my daughter was devastated you have lost my business and i wont recommend netflix to anyone
 for great content especially original work im astonished that they even have superb content in foreign languages such as german  french but they have an extremely irritating tendency to cancel great work the latest example is treason the british based miniseries spy thriller just as the male hero is killed  his wife emerges as a wonderfully strong character alongside the strong female russian spy character kara the series ends what a mistake why the world of actionthriller work dominated by characters like steven seagal needs more feminine characters
 the monopoly that netflix has in the streaming universe it is egregious how bad their customer service is having spent over an hour on the phone and following the directions from the support staff i was locked out of my account for  hours trying to change my credit card for payment when i complained i was met with the usual indifference that a huge monopoly adopts in the light of undisputed power mixed with arrogant couldnt give a  i am weighing whether to cancel my over  year association with the company and merely steal what i want from torrent sites i am beyond frustrated and angry
 has pros and cons they have a decent selection except good shows just get canceled seems to be more and more movies in foreign languages with no option for english besides it can be frustrating watching anything when lips dont match audio they are constantly upping their price and you are limited on how many screens can watch netflix i do not recommend netflix with all the other streaming apps now available we have prime hulu and others but for some reason netflix is the only one that has to be rebooted netflix is not horrible by any means its just the most expensive with the most disappointments and limitations
 am putting this out there as i havent had any issues with the application itself with it circling or billing issues i do have a problem with all these great shows popping up and then being cancelled this has been happening for awhile i have a whole list of show that have been great and then netflix decides to drop the shows or simply ghost dropped for example archive  away friends from college the umbrella academy uncoupled etc im tired of good shows getting cancelled or never heard of again it has also gotten more and more pricey to have a subscription with netflix for just  user and i just refuse to keep paying  for just one user when now disney is now charging  for  users and even hulu allows at least  users for the price of 
new the worst experience terrible condescending and extremely sarcastic actually sardonic degrading humiliating treatment from what they sadly consider customer service and so called manager david and ruben customer service billed me twice a month for over a year on  separate occasions the first time last year a wonderful lady in customer service helped me she kindly resolved this the first time not fully but she was so nice that was ok so now again they started to double charge me again
 customer service ever laughing at you and all didnt fix the problem cause they dont want to hear that its their service that is the problem and until they understand they have a problem it will not be fixed no type of credit for days of it not working i have the biggest package they have and i dont know why i even pay them  a month much less the  then when you call to get fix they blame all others and talk to you like you stupid they need better training they then said they dont have troubleshooting department i said well there is the problem i then started to tell her how much it would help to have it then guess what she was now the troubleshooting department really lol now just trying to get me to shut up  hours on phone and i still have to keep unplugging  and restarting it horrible customer service
 i have canceled netflix before in the past quite easily and then resubscribed i really appreciate that they do not make it difficult thank you for that i enjoy a lot of their content but when i am exhausted and i need another source it is very easy for me to make a change canceled my account they kept trying to bill me when i went back go my account it said it was canceled logged a dispute with my bank credit card company  after  days my bank notified me there was no response from netflix but they have  days to respond be aware of this not an honest company imo
 had a problem with my payment update my card wasnt working although it was valid i contacted netflix customer service through their website and talked with them by chat they were very quick on answering me and solved my problem in few minutes i have their service  years now and still very pleased with their content service and price have kept track of the days i was able to successfully use netflix vs the days i havent been able to both on our philips tv and vizio tv not worth  a month netflix customer service was quick to blame either our tv or our wifi instead of reimbursing us for the few days we werent able to watch i know others could get a credit per reviews and screenshots of the chats with customer service so i assumed they wanted to keep customers i was definitely wrong
 been using netflix for a very long time i dont know if theyve grown too fast or if they just make bad choices either way im tired of them im searching for another streaming site to sign up with netflix now has boring shows and movies shows and movies that arent relevant to me are nothing that i like and it just keeps getting worse quality programs have been replaced by fodder and garbage and most all of the new content they get is nothing but bollywood junk ive sent them suggestions for years obviously falling on deaf ears they just dont care another company thats gone megalomaniacal with power and greed they dont care about their customers and besides having nothing to watch on there anymore the price has doubled the more useless and worthless programs and movies they get the higher they jack up the price
 think netflix has a really great streaming service ive had others that i was not happy with other ones that have charged me for things that i was watching when i wasnt aware they were going to i didnt know that they were not free to watch netflix never charges you extra anything and it always streams very smoothly theres no buffering or nothing its a great streaming service allows me to binge awesome content both netflix original content and movies and shows their original content has great variety and are well done the content from tv and movies also have great variety as someone who is on disability and quarantined netflix has kept me entertained while i do have other streaming services amazon prime hulu youtube premium netflix is my goto when im looking for awesome entertainment
 really like netflix one of the best out there the content is very current and the original programming is better than most of the other channels they even do their own movies and get considered for the academy awards all in all i would highly recommend netflix has been around for years and it just keeps getting better i enjoy all of the quality movies tv shows and etc that are available on netflix the pricing of netflix i cant complain about either my family and i are completely happy we get to stream what we want when we want
 is an outstanding streaming service loved its tv multiseries programs especially its high quality photography and playscreen and actorsactresses very impressive and much better than our three major tv networks lineup of movies specials and comedy shows really enjoyed ozark fauda and now watching hollywood need more adult fare i also enjoyed all the narcos shows in the past thanks for coming to albuquerque
 enjoy netflix the variety can sometimes feel a little underwhelming for which good shows i want to watch they have plenty of garbage that is inexpensive for them to offer but good quality showsmovies are a little less than i would like great stream quality most of the time decent pricing options is the dominant player in this game and it shows in terms of quality variety and customer service the former two are great and the latter sucks ive been cadging off of my sisters netflix for seven years now and so have seen all of the changes in content and price that have occurred still after everything it is still a phenomenal value if you watch more than five hours of content per month i just wish there were more live sports options
 best variety of shows and best digital surround  sound better at fast processing better uhd picture the ability of remembering where you left in a middle of a show or movie new shows and the biggest selection of movies has a wide range of things to watch but i dont like the algorithms it used to suggest things when i go to other peoples houses and see some of the things suggested to them im surprised that theyre on there because ive never seen them i dont like theus new ranking of things either
 has a lot of original programming as well as movies and tv shows streaming quality is probably the best ive seen but still probably be dependent on your internet speed as a whole quality of shows is good and they are constantly adding more movies and tv shows as well as producing original stuff offers such a variety though i attempt to view a few of the other listed streamers i always go back to netflix ill peruse the others not finding anything to binge on and seek netflix i will admit i have binged on one of the streamers but the remaining content does not hold my interest my only regret with netflix is that prices were increased it should have enough subscribers to maintain the present fees for some time
 have several services but netflix has the best content never had any issues and definitely the most entertaining there are several different documentaries to choose from a lot of the documentaries are unique and hilarious i think there is a series called american vandal that my friends and i quote all the time the current circumstances with the pandemic  stay at home order this has been a lifesaver regular tv has so little to choose from netflix has their own series  movies as well as others they circulate the choices often so unlike cable tvs on demand options they have more variety netflix has great quality series  movies the ability to binge watch an entire series makes it more popular i hope the quality continues to be consistent
 god for netflix if this terrific streaming service had not come along we would still be stuck with the tedious cable companies that charge way too high prices just to make you sit through another boring commercial and they lock you in a contract too has been a life saver in this pandemic it has afforded us an opportunity to watch a lot of series that we never had time to watch sometimes we binge watch  seasons and sometimes lose interest after  episodes there is always another one to try our only negative is not being able to get disney plus that is really an infinity problem not netflix wishing that they could offer a bundle with both in sw florida
 many old b movies not enough newly released movies the entire library needs to revolve i quit the service every summer and then when return to it it seems like nothing has changed there is also far too many reality and series shows to use available across multiple device ecosystems some content is downloadable for offline use very good stream quality when you have the right plan and the internet speed to push it pricing isnt too bad and offers multiple concurrent screen plans ranging from  to  makes it hard for me to find shows that interest me the search function gives me things that are not of interest to me they also make it very hard to find the list of things im watching so i can go to the next episode i have to scroll through all kinds of things that they recommend to get to my list of keep watching
 thoroughly enjoy the content offered on my netflix subscription this is primarily all i watch i love the documentaries offered and the netflix originals is probably my favorite i love the fact that if i am in the middle of a series it will keep track for me and bring me right back to where i left off another great feature is it gets to know what you like and offers up suggestions based on previously watched programs of all the online streaming services i have found that netflix is the best netflix has the best selection of movies and all of their prices are the lowest whenever i have called 
 or contacted netflix customer service i always was treated with respect and netflix makes me feel like i am a valued customer thank you again netflix seems to operate flawlessly even on a slower network i enjoy much of their original content that is unrestrained and less mainstream compared to traditional cable television networks the ease of navigation on the app is better than any other streaming service ive used like to record my favorite shows on dvd this is why i subscribed in the first place when i tried to record a show it wouldnt let me i do enjoy watching netflix and the price is pretty good but i will probably unsubscribe soon save the money to just purchase my shows i was very disappointed with the fact that i couldnt record anything
site price is very good for streaming series i love to binge watch series on netflix i dont think netflix has the best variety when it comes to shows and movies but their own trademark series and movies are downright good and worth to watch content is free and selection is ok may have multiple seasons but additional seasons are offered on other streaming tv companies would like to see better selection and up to date seasons on continuing shows been a fan for about  years
 rated netflix variety a  because every time they put out a new and decent show they cancel it i love the movies and series they offer please stop cancelling the good shows keep the good shows and cancel the nudity raunchy shows have been a customer for many years almost since netflix became available on the market they offer a wide variety of streaming media for the price there have been occasional glitches with streaming but that could be due to the speed and quality of my internet service overall i have been very satisfied
 movies are predictable more options should be given some serials should have all the seasonit brings value when one can view all seasons shark tank one of the serial air on netflix has very few seasons also a wider range of movies especially christmas motherovies would be appreciated the discounted price i get for netflix through tmobile lots of variety in movies tv shows and original productions we do have other streaming services but i use netflix the most
 majority of the content is science fiction or somewhat on the darker side it would be nice to have a little bit lighter and more uplifting or science and familybased items and perhaps even nature or history based items  really wished i had options in settings to turn off foreign languages this way i would stop starting a movie to find out not in english bigger selection of older movies or a way to find them adding more popular movies would be good netflix has to me the very best streaming functions in their settings especially compared to amazon prime and spectrum apps
 is a good price but the movies are so old and there are so many that it takes longer to find a movie than it takes to watch one so most of the time i can never find one so i end up giving up and going to a different streaming service to find something else love netflix its much cheaper than cable i have a good wifi which is a must on getting the best service i have had netflix for several years now and i will never be able to live without it i love their original shows and movies i can highly recommend their service to anyone who wants to save money
 feel netflix is a great service reliable fast and great content i would like though to pile up services in one account instead of having to when boundless up with cable or mobile phone services overall the experience is good the app on tv and web experiences are great quality streaming i always find the movies that i am looking for wide variety of many gendered settings i think netflix is the top of the ladder in comparison to the other streaming companies i always revert back to netflix
 think netflix is a good streaming service because you have the option to cancel without any resubscription with any hassles the subscription line up is also great for family as well as individuals i often find myself disappointed with the selection on netflix its only because their original content is always top notch and i end up binging it all too quickly i cant say enough about the original content on netflix some of the best movies and shows ive seen were original to netflix and they come out with new stuff pretty frequently spanning a wide range of genres the pricing is also one of the most affordable
 got netflix  months ago i have seen  outstanding movies and now have a new favorite show kims convenience i tend to bingewatch this sitcom there are so many tv shows and movies to choose from i have lots of choices on my watch list think netflix is overpriced that being said i continue to subscribe because i enjoy the movies series and documentaries most of the older tv series i could get from other sources these are available at a cheaper rate and in some cases for free
 than gradually raising the price netflix is pretty great yes there are some really bad movies and shows on there but also many good ones once in a while i experience connection problem or excessive buffering but most of the time it works great i tried them all and netflix imo is the best streaming service out there streaming service lots of content excellent value only suggestion would be to add different content more often always steady stream without any buffering at all lots of shows i cant find anywhere else and a lot of the originals are awesome
 of the time it works well ok usually it will drop the connection i have to reboot it this is a bit of a nuisance for the price im paying which is high compared to other streaming services im not sure that i will continue to keep the service on my sis is straightened out or netflix does a price drop to be competitive with other streaming services as big a selection of movies as other services hard to find the ones we are searching for by name as the keyboard is hard to find the service doesnt have some of the oldies but goodies that the dvd service offered and it also doesnt offer the most recent ones good for viewing tv series though
 like netflix but they have a habit of freezing a lot right in the middle of what im watching i hate it i know it doesnt do it thru my dish tv so i assume its netflix i have to reset everything to get it to work and that is a pain in the youknowwhat otherwise they are greatprice shows etc just quit freezing and itll be great offers an array of options for your watching pleasure from original netflix series to movies and more i never understood binge watching  until i got a netflix account and now i can watch a whole series in a day and escape  the world and its problems great shows diversity and s to choose from makes netflix my choice
 to use interface i would prefer to see more current movies but there are some true gems in there it works great on my apple tv and my amazon fire tv i dont have a k tv yet but i look forward to enjoying k content is the best  the pricing is good  the programs are good  setup is easy  netflix is included on most if not all new smart tvs  they have produced some very good proprietary programs  when i first heard of netflix i thought what is all this hoopla about  but when i got smart tvs and also dropped cable no more cables and no more high prices and constant increases i found out  i highly recommend subscribing  if you are not satisfied there is no contract and it is easy to cancel
 something to see and new content offered every month my family and i find enjoy the variety of things to see all the time i barely watch cable anymore my list of movies and shows id like to see will surely outlast this quarantine has a wide variety of programs and movies to watch so there is something for everyone i have never had a problem with a selected program playing and if i have to stop for a while it is easy to pull up again and resume where you left off i have never had a bad experience with netflix it is always there and reliable
 variety of films that are categorized for easy selection or with userfriendly search engine iphone app allows access to movies anywhere during travels and can download and watch offline while in airplanes dont think that there is enough variety when i try to find old movies i never have any luck and i wish it was more user friendly i am glad i have netflix stream is one of the newest thing we have to be able to watch while were away from home netflix has great quality service you can binge watch series that you may have wanted to watch but didnt want to watch from season  just start it at season  and go dont have to be at home you just take it with you sit outside by your 
 pool and still watch your favorite movie netflix is up on new movies adding new ones everyday they also show you what you might be interested in by what you watch a big variety of new movies and series as well as old ones you might have forgotten need to take advantage of netflix versus cable or satellite tv service seem fine i really do not see anything that really needs to be changed especially now that netflix sends an email warning of the end of free trials k content could be improved theres not much of it
